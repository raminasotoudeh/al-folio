I am a graduate student in the Department of Sociology at Princeton University. My research is varied and includes topics in the sociology of culture, sociogenomics, public health, and social networks. Questions that interest me concern the multi-level and multi-causal nature of the social world; including the ideas that genes, attitudes, and behaviors can only be understood within the social and cultural contexts in which they emerge; and that human biologies and social environments not only interact to produce social outcomes but are mutually co-constitutive. My dissertation work leverages these ideas to study the question of why people adopt risky behaviors, from smoking to drug use, and has general implications for the fields of sociology and public health. I hold a BA in Social Research and Public Policy from NYU Abu Dhabi.
